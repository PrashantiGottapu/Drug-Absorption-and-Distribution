Chapter1: Drug-Absorption-and-Distribution
    Many factors can influence the therapeutic efficacy of a drug, including pharmacokinetics, which refers to the passage of drugs into the body, through it, and out       of the body.
    Think of pharmacokinetics as a drug’s journey through the body, during which it passes through four different phases: absorption, distribution, metabolism, and           excretion (ADME). The four steps are:
    
    Absorption: Describes how the drug moves from the site of administration to the site of action.
    Distribution: Describes the journey of the drug through the bloodstream to various tissues of the body.
    Metabolism: Describes the process that breaks down the drug.
    Excretion: Describes the removal of the drug from the body.

Chapter 2: Anti-cholinergic drugs
    Anticholinergic medications treat Parkinson’s disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and overactive bladder. Other medications, such as first-  
    generation antihistamines and tricyclic antidepressants, have anticholinergic side effects that aren’t related to the condition they treat. 
    Anticholinergic medications can cause side effects, including confusion and memory problems. Constipation and difficulty peeing can also happen. These side effects 
    can be especially dangerous for older adults.
    Many medications have anticholinergic properties. Ask your pharmacist if any of your medications could cause anticholinergic side effects.

Chapter 3: Drug Excretion
      Drug excretion is the removal of drugs from the body, either as a metabolite or unchanged drug. There are many different routes of excretion, including urine, bile, sweat, saliva, tears, milk, and stool. By far, the most important excretory organs are the kidney and liver. In kidney, excretion of drugs depends on glomerular filtration, active tubular secretion, and passive tubular absorption. Urine and blood pH and the physical characteristics of the drug molecule are important in determining whether the drug is excreted in the urine or remains in the circulation. Drugs appearing in bile will enter the intestines and may be reabsorbed resulting in enterohepatic circulation. Biliary excretion eliminates substances from the body only to the extent that enterohepatic cycling is incomplete. Drugs with a molecular weight (MW) exceeding 300 daltons and with polar and lipophilic groups are more likely to be excreted in bile. Clearance is a measure of the ability of the body to eliminate a drug. The elimination behavior of a drug is described most simply by its half-life, the time needed for the drugs concentration to be halved.
